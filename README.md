# IOT-Based-Power-Outlet-WeMos-
A 4 sockets power outlet which can be controlled by online or in the local network. The project is based on WeMos for all tasks. The Project is designed in two forms one is it can be controlled by online service like Thingspeak and the other is controlled by local server. (My own Home Automation System).
